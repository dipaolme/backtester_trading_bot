# Backtester Trading Bot



Performance analysis of 3 intraday trading strategies on 41 stocks

Each strategy is based on the implementation of different values for the stop loss (SL), take profit (TP) and trail (TR) parameters according to different criteria

The  strategies for each action were implemented in a period of 3 months in 3-minute candles using the backtester python  library


Alpaca API was used to obtain the required data (credentials required)
